# UCSD_ECE_271A_Projects
ECE 271A is a course focused on statistical learning. It has 4 homeworks which have extensive computer assignments. These assignments focus on the recognition of a cheetah in a black & white png image, by machine learning. In different homeworks, progressively better methods are used for the recognition of the image. 

All the coding for the homeworks are done in MATLAB. The relevant .m files for each homework is in their respective folders. Also in each folder, files that are required externally are given. Finally in the Homework_explanation part of each folder, the original homework questions and my report about my results are given.

For each seperate homework, only the last question is the actual computer assignment. The other questions are pen & paper types of questions. In this repository, only the computer assignment questions' solutions are given.
