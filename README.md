# UCSD Statistical Learning I & II Assignments

## Statistical Learning I
This course focuses on Generative Machine Learning methods. First 4 assignments belong to this course. They include mathematical and coding sections. These assignments focus on visual recognition using traditional machine learning methods. In different assignments, progressively better methods are used for the recognition of the image. 

## Statistical Learning II
This course focuses on Discriminative Machine Learning methods. Last 4 assignments (5 to 8) are part of this course. Several traditionally important ML algorithms are introduced, such as Dimensionality Reduction, Multi Layer Perceptrons, Boosting and Support Vector Machines.

All the coding for the assignments are done in MATLAB. The relevant .m files for each assignment is in their respective folders.

For each separate assignment, only the last question is the actual computer assignment. The other questions are pen & paper types of questions.
